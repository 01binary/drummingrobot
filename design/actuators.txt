360 watts = 6 actuators

Linear Heavy: 12 VDC by 5 Amps = 60 Watts draw
Linear Light: 12 VDC by 1.4 Amps = 16.8 Watt

Solenoid: 12 VDC 10 Watts

Forearm actuator
	4 lb for the upper arm (over-estimated by .5 lb)
	Needs linear actuator with a force of at least 27.4 lb
	12V, 110lb, 3" stroke, .88 lbs

Upper arm actuator
	7 lb + .88 lb for the forearm actuator
	Let's say 8 lb
	Max 8
	Min 4.7
	Travel 4"
	12V, 150lb, 4" stroke, 2.2 lbs

Arm rotation servo: 12 VDC by 1.4Amps = 16.8 Watt


1 large arm = 60W + 16.8W + 10W + 16.8W = 86.8W
4 large arms = 364 Watts

1 small arm = ?

Rotator base torque??

Need moments of Inertia to calc all that, so back to design.

+ 4 small arms + base rotation servo? Let's forget about the wheel drive for now.
Get a huge PS and worry about it later.

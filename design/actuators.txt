360 watts = 6 actuators

Linear Heavy: 12 VDC by 5 Amps = 60 Watts draw
Linear Light: 12 VDC by 1.4 Amps = 16.8 Watt
Solenoid: 12 VDC 10 Watts
Arm rotation servo: 12 VDC by 1.4Amps = 16.8 Watt


1 large arm = 60W + 16.8W + 10W + 16.8W = 86.8W
4 large arms = 364 Watts

1 small arm = ?

Rotator base torque??

Need moments of Inertia to calc all that, so back to design.

+ 4 small arms + base rotation servo? Let's forget about the wheel drive for now.
Get a huge PS and worry about it later.



P(W) = I(A) Ã— V(V)

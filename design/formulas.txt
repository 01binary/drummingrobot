Ohm's law
V = I * R

Power Loss and Wattage calculation
P = I * V = I^2 * R = V ^ 2 / R

Resistance in series = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 ...)
Resistance in series (2) = R1 * R2 / (R1 + R2)

Voltage divider = 10% rule (bleeder)
Seleect R2 so that I2 is 10% of desired load current

Let's say we need step 5 volt down to 3.3 volt.

V source = V R1 + V R2

5 = 3.3 (R1) + x (R2)

V R2 = 1.7 (the drop)

V R1 = I * R1
V R2 = I * R2 = 3.3

(the current is common for both)

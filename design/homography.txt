I made many concessions:

- I agreed to stay outside business hours to deploy items
- I agreed to take on a manager role by coordinating QA, DevOps, and Cloud team for every task
- I agreed to fill in for QA, DBAs, and DevOps to work on tasks that they are responsible for
- I agreed to unresonably high operational overhead of using DevTrack process not understood by anyone in the company, and waiting months for the simplest changes to be deployed
- I spent months on research to prove the utility of things that the rest of the world adapted and has been proven by experience
- I agreed to work with developers that cannot learn
- I agreed to continuously implement decisions that will hurt the company in the long term, such as SCM as the configuration provider and lack of API design discipline
- I agreed to working extra hours this spring for as long as I could sustain this, which cost me my psychological health and made it impossible to have a positive attitute at work
- I agreed to transition to PAW, which blocks many sites I need for everyday work, crashes, creates high operational overhead as I have to wait for projects to load, deal with issues of broken source control and crashing Visual Studio plugins, repeatedly sign in on multiple virtual machines, and work everyday knowing that my productivity is significantly lower than it was when I first joined the company
